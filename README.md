Title: Fundamentals of C++ Programming – Basics, Variables, Data Types, and I/O
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code

Overview
This repository showcases a series of beginner-friendly C++ programs created to build a solid base in programming. Each code example covers essential concepts like user input/output, data types, arithmetic operations, and program flow. The objective is to provide hands-on experience in writing and understanding basic C++ syntax and logic.

1. Basic Output Program ("Hello, World!")
This is the classic starting point for any programming journey. It helps introduce the basic syntax and layout of a C++ program.

Concepts Demonstrated:

Inclusion of header file #include <iostream> for I/O operations

The main() function as the program’s entry point

Use of cout to print output to the screen

Sample Output:

css
Copy
Edit
HELLO WORLD  
HI! I AM AKSHIT CHORDIA
Purpose:
To get familiar with the program structure and output statements in C++.

2. Arithmetic Calculator
This program simulates a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

Takes two floating-point numbers from the user using cin

Executes all four basic operations

Outputs the results with clear labeling

Sample Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 45  
Enter the second number: 90  

Addition: 135  
Subtraction: -45  
Multiplication: 4050  
Division: 0.5
Purpose:
To understand how to take input, process calculations, and display results — a core skill in all programming applications.

Conclusion
These introductory programs help establish a strong command of C++ fundamentals. By practicing with these examples, learners can develop confidence in writing basic programs, which is essential before moving on to more complex topics like loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and object-oriented concepts.
